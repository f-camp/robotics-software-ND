This repository contains my implementation of projects for Udacity's Robotic Software Engineer Nanodegree Program.

## Project 1: Build a Gazebo World

This project builds a gazebo world, including elements of robot, world environment and other static object.


## Project 2: Go Chase It!

In this project, a two wheeled robot is programmed to chase a white ball in gazebo. Velocity commands are sent to the robot based on the location of the white ball in the robot's camera frame.


## Project 3: Where Am I?
